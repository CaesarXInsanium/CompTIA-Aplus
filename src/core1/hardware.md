# Section 3: Hardware

## 3.1 Copper Network Cables

- Cable is fundamental for network communication. There is only one chance to
  do correct installation
- Twisted Pair
  - Balanced pair operation. Two wires transmit equal and opposite signals
  - Transmit+, transmit, receive +, receive --
  - Twist keep interference minimal. Constantly moving away from interference. Opposite
    signals are compared to each other at the end
  - Different pairs have different twist rates

### Cabling standards

### Cable Protection

- No plenum: air circulation in drop ceiling of building.
  - Aside from ventilation
- plenum: building air circulation. Heating and air conditioning
  - fire hazard and fume hazard, one wires go on fir
  - plenum rated cable uses DEP or low-smoke PVC in order t
                reduce risk of fumes
  - traditional cable jacket uses PVC that release fume
                when burnt
  - plenum rated is not as flexible. Safety precautions i
                more important. Worst case planning

### Un-shielded vs Shielded Cables

- UTP: un-shielded twisted pair
  - No additional shielding other than the PVC. Most common pair cabling
- TSP: shielded twisted pair
  - Additional protections protect against interference
  - Can shield individual pairs or overall cable.
  - Cable must be grounded
  - -U = PUT, -S = braided shielding, -F = foil shielding
  - Braided: around entire cable
  - Foil: around the cable and no shielding around the pairs is the F/UT
- Termination

    - Eight conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling
  - T568A and T568B
    - Different pins assignments for 8P8C connectors
    - Assigns the T568A pin-out to horizontal cabling

  - Duplexing options available for certain models
- Cartridge and belt
  - Ink cartridges are moved over the paper
  - Belt moves the cartridges back and forth. Moving part
- Calibration
  - Align nozzles to the paper. Lines should be crisp and color should align
  - Look at alignment page to check line and color calibration
- Maintenance
  - Cleaning print heads
  - Might have small droplets of ink.
  - Clogged heads are a big issue. Many printers clean every day.
  - Output might have streaks or sections of missing color
  - Automated cleaning process.
  - Cleaning process can be started manually
  - Check for clogged print heads.
  - Replacing ink-jet
    - Separate colors for each. Certain cartridges might combine
    - Takes seconds to replace
    - Recycle by sending to manufacturer
  - Clearing jams
    - Lots of turns and twists. Jam is inevitable
    - Remove tray paper
    - Remove paper from the path. Form pressure don't rip
    - Check for loose scraps
- Calibration
  - Check output after replacing cartridge. Align nozzles to paper
  - Printer includes calibration option

### Thermal printers

- Use white paper that turns black when heat using special paper
- Very quiet, only moving parts are used to push paper.
- Paper is sensitive to light and heat. Generally the papers fades over time
- Feed assembly: pull paper through the printer. Designed to be replaceable
- Heating element: no moving print head. Head certain
sections at a time
- Thermal paper covered in chemical that changes
colors when heated
- Thermal paper must match model of printer
- Maintenance
  - Thermal replacement
  - MUST GET CORRECT Size and type
  - Different sizes, keep list of proper of models
  - Actual replacement is easy/fast.
  - Impossible to substitute for correct type
- Cleaning
  - Liquid cleaner IPA, get cleaning pen, check manufacturers recommendations
  - Swab gently
  - Can use a cleaning card and paper pathways.
  - Blow printers to remove debris. Avoid use vacuums unless designed for computers

### Impact printers

- Print heads with small matrix of pins
- Presses against ribbon to make mark on paper.
- Good for carbon/multiple copies
- Low cost per page. But very noisy.
- Low resolution output. Use for letters and numbers
- Dot matrix print head: moves back and forth and pins are pushed across the paper
- One matrix, head must move across the paper
- Printer ribbon: modular case the contains enough ribbon. Easy to replace
- Propriety size, must fit printer model to replace
- Tractor feed: paper pulled through the holes
- Paper through the holes with the side of the paper. Holes must line up perfectly
- Maintenance
  - Ribbon replacement
  - Single ribbon. Self-contained one long circle.
  - Replace when the ink becomes too light. Ink is eventually consumed.
  - Specific to model to when replacing
  - Print head
  - Takes a lot of abuse, directly hits the ribbon and the paper.
  - Gets very hot, let it cool
  - Designed to be modular and replaced
- Paper
  - Not as easy in laser printer. Paper feed must be perfect to for holes
  - Forms must be positioned correctly. Text may need to fit predefined space
  - Paper must feed without constraint

### Virtual and 3D printers

- No physical output. Creating digital documents.
- Used to be sent electronically
- Print to file
- Saved file to printable format. Uses file format specific to be opened by printer.
- Command line necessary
- Print to PDF
  - Portable document format. One way path from application
  - Propriety adobe format. Requires software to create view
  - PDF reader built into internet browsers
- Print to XPS
  - Microsoft XPS. Similar to PDF
  - Available on all Windows back to XP
- Print to image
  - Uses graphics image file format. For image editing and sharing
  - Third party software is used to do this
- 3d printer
  - Take electronic model and create physical model
  - Additive manufacturing create object layer by layer
  - Rapid prototyping. Design and create.
  - Display designs anywhere in the world. Or space
