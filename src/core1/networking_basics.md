# Section 2: Networking Basics

## 2.1 Ports and Protocols

- Protocols used to efficiently transfer large amounts of data for different applications
- IP is protocol that usually transmits the data over the internet using encapsulation.
- Multiplexing: multiple functions inside of single network
- TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
  - connection oriented. Formal setup and close
  - reliable form of deliver. Recovery for errors, manage out of order messages
  - flow control. Receiver manages how much data is sent
- UDP: User Datagram Protocol
  - connection less, no formal or close to connections
  - unreliable delivery. No error recovery, no reordering of data
- IP: internet protocol. Delivery truck methodology to data. All devices that connect
  to networks have IP and MAC address.
- Non-ephemeral port number: assigned to specific application (0-123)
- Ephemeral port number: 1024 to 65535. Determined real time by client
- Most servers are non-ephemeral
- Port numbers are for communication not security. Active port numbers must be known.
  PCT application used different ports then DUP

## 2.2 Network Devices

- NIC: Network Interface Card
  - Basic interface for network applications. All devices connected to networks
    have some sort of NIC
  - Specific card required for different mediums: WIFI, Ethernet
  - Generally built into device
- Repeater
  - Receives and repeats signals. No decisions
- Hub: multi-port repeater
  - Incoming traffic is repeated across all ports. Functions as multi-port repeater
- Bridge: switch with 2-4 ports
  - Forwarding decisions based on MAC address
  - connects different network architectures, example: Ethernet to WIFI
  - PAW is example of bridge
- Switches
  - Application specific integrated circuit
  - forwarding based on MAC address
  - Many ports and features: core of enterprise networks
  - Multi-layer switches can forward based on IP address
  - Unman aged Switches have basic forwarding, plug and play. Low price point

- Routing via WAN and SLD port. Route between internal network an outside network
- Minimal configuration required. Automatic by connecting appropriate devices
- Allows for wireless management. Configure frequencies, security protocols, IP
  addressing
- Can integrate enterprise level security

### SOHO Firewall

- Every SOHO router has integrated firewall
  - DMZ: ports can be configured to allows unrestricted access. However best practice
    is to declared rules for forwarding
- NAT: Network address Translation. Allows for more devices to connect to outside
  internet than there are addresses available. Converts internal private IP address
  to public address.
  - Static: one-to-one mapping. Best for internet access to internal network device.
    Does not usually change
  - Dynamic: maps internal IP to single public IP address form NAT pool of IP addresses.
    Varies between availability of public addresses
  - PAT (Port Address Translation): router makes the forwarding decisions based
    on port numbers between external and internal. Afterwards it changes the port
    number to the destination

### Other Terms

- Port forwarding: 24x7 access to service hosted internally. External port maps
  to internal host
- UPnP: universal plug and play. Allows devices to automatically configure and find
  other network devices.
  - Applications can use this but requires option to be supported.
- IoT: internet of things. Home/building automation, wireless devices. Management
  and security concerns. But makes things convenient
- Content Filtering: filters content IP, port
  - Whitelist: nothing past firewall except for defined items
  - Blacklist: everything allowed except for defined items
- MAC Filtering: allows for communications to be blocked based on MAC address
- Wireless: best practice to use, highest level of encryption available. WPA2 over
  WPA. WPA better than PEW.
- QoS: quality of service. Change priority of traffic types. For voice, gaming, web,
  streaming, etc. must be chosen carefully in enterprise setting
